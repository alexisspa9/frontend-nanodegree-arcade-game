===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).



1.How to run the game

In order to run and play the game you simply double click the index.html and the game opens up to your browser.

2.How to play the game

Instructions are easy:
	Try to score as musch as you can by collecting gems without colliding with the enemy bugs. If that happens the game resets.
	In order to move the character use the arrow keys.
	When the game launches choose a character with the arrow keys and press enter.


Try your best!!! Happy playing....
